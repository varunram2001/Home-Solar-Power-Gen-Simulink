The project utilizes various electronic components to harness and convert solar energy into usable electrical power.

Components:
1. Solar Panel
The solar panel serves as the primary source of energy in this system. It absorbs sunlight and converts it into direct current (DC) electricity.

2. Resistor
The resistor is used to limit the current flowing through the circuit, ensuring safe operation and preventing damage to the components.

3. Inductor
The inductor is employed to smooth out the current flow and reduce voltage fluctuations in the system.

4. Passive Filter
The passive filter helps in reducing unwanted harmonics and noise in the electrical signal, ensuring a cleaner and more stable output.

5. Diode
The diode acts as a one-way valve, allowing the flow of current in a single direction. It prevents reverse current flow from the battery to the solar panel.

6. Universal Bridge
The universal bridge is a key component in the inverter circuit. It converts the DC electricity from the solar panel into alternating current (AC) suitable for household use.

7. IGBT Diode
The Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) diode is utilized for controlling the flow of current through the circuit, enabling efficient energy conversion.
